#KABOODLE
     

##General Assembly WDI Project 2, November 2014
<br />


##Overview

Kaboodle was created to fill the gap for businesses that can't afford a large PR firm...and for people interested in the PR space to get their start (recent grads, etc.), build a portfolio, and make money!

It is a web application that runs contests to generate crowd sourced ideas for PR & Marketing campaigns that businesses can immediately implement.

Kaboodle was developed for a project for the Fall 2014 Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly in Atlanta, GA. It was developed over a week-long sprint to model the agile software development process.
